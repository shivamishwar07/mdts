1] actual start and Expected duration will be editable in case of InProgress 
        default setting
                 actual start
                 case1-> if no prerequisite => keep as per planned
                 case2-> if prerequisite => Actual finish date of prerequisite of the last one + 1
        Default Setting->Expected duration
                 will be planned duration or (today date - actual start) date which ever is maximum. expected duration can not go below (today date - actual start date) in case of below then take planned duration.
                 If actual start exceeds the today date then actual/expected duration will be actual start - todays date and based on 
        default settings->actual finish
                 Will be the actual start+ actual/expected duratio      n.
                 if actual start date is already passed then we need to do calculation (todays date - actual start) and duration which is bigger that will be the actual/expected duration and actual finish will be actual start+ newly generated actual/expected duration.
                 
2] actual start and actual finish and expected duration in case of completed.
          Default Setting
                  If it was already in inprogress then aactual start will be same and based on expected duration actual finish will be calculated
                  we can always update the actual start and actual finish if they dont have any child activity if there is child activit then they should be in yet to start mode.
